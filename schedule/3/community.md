## Breakout Discussions
<div class="message">
In small groups, brainstorm a list of ideas for ways you could use ML in your communities!  <b>Think big and small</b>.
</div>

Then consider the following questions together:
>+ How would you prioritize which opportunity to go after first? Why do you think your favorite opportunity is the most important?
+ What data would you need to collect?
+ How could you go about collecting that data? What kinds of sensors might you need?
+ How would you deploy your system? How often would it need to communicate? What kind of battery life would it need?
+ How might the data drift over time? How might you correct that?
+ How will you make sure your system protects peopleâ€™s privacy? Can you make sure it is secure?

## Large Group Discussion
As we return, let's discuss the following together;
>+ What did you think was the most **exciting idea** from your breakout discussion? Why?
+ What do you think will be the **hardest challenges** faced by all of your ideas? What are some ways to **overcome** those challenges?
